  <a name="whatisecho360"></a><h1>What is Echo 360®?</h1><br>
  Echo 360 is a Lecture Capture System.&nbsp; The system enables faculty to record audio, course visuals, and optional video for students to review in digital format. This provides students with a powerful tool that can be used for review, or to supplement materials covered in class, or to provide instruction that is entirely web-based.&nbsp; Students will have the ability to seek forward or back in a presentation to particular segments of the captured session.&nbsp; The captures can be viewed via a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari), and/or be downloaded to a computer or mobile device.<br>
</p><br>
<p><h3>There are 4 components to the Echo 360 system:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Echo 360 Lecture Capture Classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This is a classroom that has been equipped with special hardware to accommodate the digital capture of an instructor led class.&nbsp; The classroom includes an installation of the Echo 360 Personal Capture Software on the podium computer, along with special microphones and cameras to record the faculty member and any materials displayed through the projector.&nbsp; There are several of these classrooms on campus.&nbsp; They are located in the following buildings/rooms:&nbsp; Daniel 100B, P&amp;A 174, and Brackett 100, Academic Success Center 118, Cooper Library 309, Jordan Hall G032 &amp; G033, Tillman 314 &amp; 315, Life Sciences Building 142 &amp; 026.&nbsp; If you are scheduled to teach in one of these classrooms, you can email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ITHELP@clemson.edu">ITHELP@clemson.edu</a>&nbsp;to learn how to get an account and setup your lectures to be captured.  This system is not integrated with Canvas or Blackboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Echo 360 Personal Capture Software.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a software application that can be installed on Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac OS X 10.7 and above.&nbsp; This software application allows instructors to record audio, webcam video and screen sharing video.&nbsp; Screen sharing video captures the movements and activities on an instructor&rsquo;s computer.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Echo 360 Server.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The Echo 360 server is where the files created with the Echo 360 Lecture Capture Classroom and the Echo 360 Personal Capture Software will reside.&nbsp; The Echo 360 files/recordings will be archived at the end of each semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Faculty will be able to store files for up to 3 semesters on the Echo 360 server.&nbsp; At the end of that time the recordings will be placed in the archive for 3 semesters.  All archived lectures will be deleted from the server after 3 semesters.  Each faculty member will have 5 GB per class.</strong>&nbsp; For example, if a faculty member has 3 sections of a class, the faculty member will be able to upload up to 5 GB of lecture capture per section.</li>
</ul>
