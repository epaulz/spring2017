        <div id="panel1a" class="content">
			We have bulk migrated Blackboard courses into Canvas for the following semesters: Fall 2015, Spring 2016, Summer 2016.  Course name and ID remains the same in Canvas as it was in Blackboard.

    <li class="accordion-navigation">
        <a href="#panel2a">Export a Blackboard Course</a>
        <div id="panel2a" class="content active">
			Use the Export Course tool to create a package file containing all of the course content for reuse in Canvas or to serve as your own backup.  This tool does not include any users or user interactions with the course.  For instructions on how to export your course, visit <a href="https://en-us.help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Course_Content/Reuse_Content/Export_and_Archive_Courses" target="_blank">this webpage</a>.

    <li class="accordion-navigation">
        <a href="#panel3a">Download Grades from the Grade Center</a>
        <div id="panel3a" class="content">
			Grades must be downloaded by instructors.  All instructors should download copies of the Blackboard course grades, especially if you have students with incomplete grades.  Downloaded grades can be used in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.  For instructions on how to do this, visit <a href="https://en-us.help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Grade/Grading_Tasks/Work_Offline_With_Grade_Data#Download_grades_from_the_Grade_Center" target="_blank">this webpage</a>.

			Please make sure to adhere to the Registrar's <a href="http://www.registrar.clemson.edu/FERPA/ferpa.htm">FERPA guidelines</a> for storing sensitive data.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>NOTE: Entering grades into the Blackboard Grade Center is NOT the official process for reporting student grades.  Official final grades are entered in iRoar (iRoar > Faculty Services > Final Grades).</strong>

        <a href="#panel4a">Students with Incomplete Grades or Assignments</a>
        <div id="panel4a" class="content active">

We recommend that you download assignments, tests or other data for your own records and set up a Canvas course for those students to complete their course work if it will not be completed before May 17, 2017.
