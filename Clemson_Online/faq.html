<h2>Lecture Capture Transition</h2>
<ul class="accordion" data-accordion="">
<li class="accordion-navigation"><a href="#panel1a">Why is the university changing its lecture capture software?</a>
<div class="content" id="panel1a">When the license for our previous software (Echo 360) was up for renewal at the end of 2016, some questions were raised about whether or not this was the best system for Clemson. Then, Echo 360 notified us that the end of product support would be January 1, 2017 and that the only option moving forward was their Echo ALP pilot, which proved unsuccessful. So we began researching other lecture capture software that would meet all of our growing needs. Among these needs are a seamless feel for students whether on campus or online, the ability to interact with students verbally on campus and online students simultaneously, and more. When Echo 360 went up for bid again, it came back that it would be cost prohibitive and too expensive compared to many of our other licenses. Furthermore, we experienced accessibilty issues when testing the new pilot. The decision was finally made that Echo 360 ALP would not meet the needs of the university.</div>
