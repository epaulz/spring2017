NAME:	Eric Paulz

---------
example.c
---------
1) What is the cause of the seg fault in the program called example.c?

The arguments of the for loop basically say that 'i' starts at zero and that while
i>=0 that 'i' will be incremented the next time around.  Since no other limitations
were put on it, 'i' will increase forever (the number will never be <0).  The array
'data' goes from 1-5, but the computer will read it as 0-4.  As soon as the for loop
tries to call an element of the array that is >4 we get an error because there is no
such element.

broken.c

2) What line in broken.c did the program seg fault on?
Line 28

3) What was the value of the variable "count" at the time of the seg fault?
count = 10

4) What was the value of the variable "i" at the time of the seg fault?
i = 613

5) What was the value of the variable "search" at the time of the seg fault?
search = 1

6) What are the values in the "table" array?
table = {5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26}

7) What do you think the bug is?

The argument for the while loop on Line 27 is the cause of the error.  It says 
'while(search=1)' which is actually ASSIGNING a value of 1 to the variable 'search'.
The argument of a while loop should be a conditional statement, not an assignment.
If we simply change it to 'while(search == 1)' the program will continue and run as
it is supposed to.
