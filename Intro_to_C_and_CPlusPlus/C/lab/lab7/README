Lab 7 Fall 2016:  reverse_echo

This is a modified version of a program originally written by Kyle Krafka, 
Oct. 30, 2013

Description:
   reverse_echo is a variant of a standard Linux command: echo.  In the echo
   command, arguments passed from the command line are all printed out,
   separated by spaces, with a newline character at the end.  reverse_echo
   does the same, except the arguments entered at the command line are 
	printed out in reverse order.

   For example, if the executable is renamed as   reverse_echo   and you 
   type the following to run it:

       ./reverse_echo testing 1 2 3

   the program will print out the following:
								       
       3 2 1 testing


Compile Instructions:
   gcc -Wall -o reverse_echo reverse_echo.c

Run Instructions:
   ./reverse_echo <arg1> <arg2> ... <argn>
