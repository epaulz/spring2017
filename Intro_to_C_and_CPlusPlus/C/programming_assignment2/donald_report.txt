Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!

Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.

Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.

"@trumplican2016: .@realDonaldTrump There will be MASSIVE turnout for you, Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!

I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!

I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes

Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.

The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?

I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.

Crooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors. Owned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you. www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hill…

Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!

Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!

Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?

Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.

Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.

My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting

The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!

Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong!

Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!

.@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!

I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!

Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!

The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!

Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!

While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!

Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!

Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!

"@Stvzbnk: Just Watched @tonyschwartz. Obviously Tony is a Total Whack Job @realDonaldTrump"

Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.

I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope!

Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!

Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!

Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.

.@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.

The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

"@CherNuna: @realDonaldTrump It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this, then it's that.

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?

The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

"@AnneBellar: @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!"

Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!

Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source

.@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

"@PMNOrlando: @realDonaldTrump I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary! Her rallies are held in (blank) & she still has room.

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES. Full speech transcript: www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/…

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument! www.snappytv.com/tc/2673821

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise

Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!

President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!

Hillary Clinton strongly stated that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!

It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!

The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
