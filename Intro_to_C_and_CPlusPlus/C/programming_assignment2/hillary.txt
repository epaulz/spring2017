This election is about whether we’re a country that lifts each other up or tears each other down. IWillVote.com
National service has always been a bipartisan goal. When it's hard to find common ground, it's important we come together where we can.
However you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to work toward making something good happen in the world.
This is one of the best things about Americans—we’re doers. When we see something that needs fixing, we roll up our sleeves and get to work.
Every good thing that we’ve ever achieved has always been because people have worked together to make it happen. hrc.io/2dqq2eE
Trump stood up at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation—one that in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America we know.
This race comes down to two things: what kind of future we want for our kids and how we achieve it. pbs.twimg.com/media/CtnVTRtWIAIDehq…

Hillary’s speaking in Florida on her plan to expand opportunities for national service. Watch here: on.msnbc.com/2dcYo6Q
While Donald continues day 5 of his Machado meltdown, we'll be in Florida talking about national service. You'll want to watch.
Trump on equal pay: "Do as good a job" as men. Abortion? Should be "punished." Pregnancy? An "inconvenience." Wives working? "Dangerous."
We've heard Donald's insults for years, and his policies reflect this disregard—even contempt—for women.
Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight when she was pregnant. Pathetic.
To Donald, women like Alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks. lat.ms/2dtVcz3 pbs.twimg.com/media/CtnDsnqXEAImDcg…
When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.
Alicia deserves praise for courageously standing up to Trump's attacks. And he has the gall to blame her—and say he "helped"?
What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?
