1. The main problems that I encountered involved rotating the rectangular
   image to the right or left. The rest of the project was pretty
   straightforward.  It took a lot of thought at times.  It was pretty
   time-consuming, but not too rigorous.
2. I realized that I was going to have to switch the width and height
   in the header before allocating memory for a new array, otherwise
   I would get a segmentation fault when trying to populate the
   array.
3. At first I hated it because my code worked perfectly on the square
   image, but not at all on the rectangular one.  After getting the
   updated image1, though, it wasn't so bad.  After completing the
   project I realize that it gave me really great practice with lots
   of different things like: reading in files, dynamically allocating memory,
   developing algorithms within for loops and nested for loops, and working
   with pointers.  Overall I think it was a good assignment!
