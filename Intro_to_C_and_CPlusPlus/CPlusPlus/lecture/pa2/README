1. At first I was having difficulty understanding how to use instances of
   objects within other classes.  I was trying to follow the structure given
   in the write-up to a T, and that just wasn't working out for me.

2. I thought it through and thought back to working with structures last
   semester, and I saw some similarities.  Using the required hierarchy of
   classes, I restructured my program to fit my own understanding a bit better.
   As soon as I did this it all started making much more sense and I was
   able to complete the assignment in no time.  I only used setters and
   getters and did not use any overloaded constructors.  This just made more
   sense to me.

3. I thought this assignment was OK.  Honestly, I am kind of tired of working
   with PPM images so much.  I understand that they are helpful in teaching
   a lot of things, but I wish we would use what we are learning for more than
   just one application.  I found that this program could have been written
   with maybe 1 or 2 classes as opposed to 5.  I get that it was to help us
   learn about using classes within eachother, but I think it would have been
   more interesting if we could have done something that REALLY REQUIRED that
   type of thing as opposed to taking a simpler program and breaking it up as
   much as possible just for the sake of an assignment.
