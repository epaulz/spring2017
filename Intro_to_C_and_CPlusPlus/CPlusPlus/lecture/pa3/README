    My main problem was being able to get the rectangle to print out right.
    I was able to solve this by creating 3 Triangle objects within the 
    Quadrilateral class and treat those triangles like I did the main
    triangle in the driver.

    It also took me a while to figure out how to write this program so that it 
    could handle images of any dimension.  I decided to create an empty 2D
    vector inside my Image class and then write a function that would resize
    that vector once the width and height of the image had been read in.

    I think it was a good assignment that built off of alot of things that we
    learned throughout the semester.  It took me alot longer to complete than
    I thought it would, but it was very rewarding when I finally worked out
    all of the bugs!
